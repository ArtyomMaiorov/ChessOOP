# ChessOOP
Chess program implemented with OOP approach.
This program is created by Maiorov Artyom during 2nd year of bachelor at KBTU as a part of OOP course. 
Pieces mechanics, capturing logic, pawn promotion, castling and check mechanism are implemented.
I still need to implement checkmate, en passant and player turns.
Feel free to distribute.
